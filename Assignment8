  <h1>Devious New Deep Sea Creature Hid Its Identity From Scientists Unitl Now, NYT</h1>

  <h2> It took nearly 25 years for biologists to discover that a swimming and glowing organism in the oceans midnight zone was actually a sea slug.
    The mysterious creature, now named Bathydevius caudactylus, was observed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.
  </h2>

<p><b><i>By: William J. Broad</i></b></p>

<p>Bruce Robison, a marine biologist, has long used robotic vehicles to explore the Monterey Canyon off California — 
a gargantuan rift of the Pacific seabed that descends rapidly from coastal shallows to a depth of more than two miles.
In early 2000, he stumbled on a strange creature he had never seen before.</p>

<p> “We had no idea what it was,” 
  <a href="https://www.mbari.org/person/bruce-h-robison/"> Dr. Robison </a> recalled. </p>

<p> The gelatinous blob had a giant hood at one end, fingerlike projections at the other and colorful internal organs in between. 
  Baffled, Dr. Robison and a colleague at the <a href="https://www.mbari.org/"> Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute </a> set out to discover what it was. </p>

  <p> Now, a quarter-century later, having studied 157 of those enigmatic organisms in their dark habitats as well as in the laboratory, the two scientists are making their conclusions public. 
  The newly identified creature, they report in a public release on Tuesday, turns out to represent a whole new family of living things that reside in the midnight world of the oceans vast midwaters — the largest and least explored part of the planets biosphere. 
  Moreover, it looks and behaves unlike any of its closest relatives on the tree of life. </p>

<p>The discoverers say the creature is a surprising new kind of nudibranch, or sea slug. 
  Nudibranchs (Latin for “naked gills”) get their name from that fact that they are nude, unlike their snail cousins on land. </p>

<p>What sets the organism apart from its marine relatives — and what makes the discovery so astonishing — is that it swims. Up to now, most nudibranchs known to science were described as inching their way over coral reefs, sea grass beds, kelp forests, the deep seafloor and rocky tide pools.

</p>

<p>By contrast, Dr. Robison and his colleague, Steven Haddock, found that the newly identified creature is neutrally buoyant — that is, it can float effortlessly underwater, not sinking or rising. Striking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MszfZriuVVs"> video </a> footage shows how, from that weightless state, it moves gracefully through its dark habitat, slowly undulating its entire body up and down.

</p>

<p>More dramatically, the scientists found it can also expel water rapidly from its hood — producing jet-like bursts that send it moving quickly backward to escape predators.

</p>

<p>The organisms highly elastic hood, it turns out, is an oral cavity that can expand and contract to trap shrimp and other crustaceans, much as a Venus flytrap does with insects.

</p>

<p>The fingerlike projections turn out to be part of its paddle-like tail, the scientists report. They also note that the nudibranch, like many creatures of the midnight realm, can light up in brilliant displays of bioluminescence. The glow radiates from luminous dots that give the animal a starry look.

</p>

<p> Long studies of the oceans sunless depths have shown that the reproductive behavior of abyssal creatures can, by human standards, get weird. That applies to the nudibranch, too: The scientists found that the new animal is a hermaphrodite, possessing both male and female sex organs. In the boundless immensities of the deep sea, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063724001845?via%3Dihub">they wrote</a>, the bisexual lifestyle can “maximize the chances for reproductive success.”

</p>

<p> In the institute’s news release, Dr. Robison said the team’s discovery added “a new piece” to the midnight-zone puzzle, helping science understand not only unfamiliar aspects of the planet’s largest habitat but also the natural history of some of its fascinating residents.

</p>

<p>He called them “neighbors that share our blue planet.”
